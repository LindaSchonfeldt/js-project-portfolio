# About

This is my personal portfolio where I showcase a selection of my projects in UX/UI design and frontend development. It includes case studies, prototypes, and coding projects that reflect my skills in creating thoughtful, user-centered solutions.

The portfolio is built using:

- React for component-based architecture
- Vite for fast build and development environment
- Styled Components for writing CSS in JavaScript
- Netlify for hosting and continuous deployment

I created this site as a platform to share my work, experiment with new tools, and grow as a designer and developer. 
Feel free to explore and reach out!
